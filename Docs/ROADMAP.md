# PF2e Tactical RPG — LLM-First Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Stable Vertical Slice
- Playable encounter in `SampleScene` with clear start/end flow.
- Reliable turn loop (initiative, 3 actions, enemy turn execution).
- MVP combat feedback (initiative bar, combat log, damage popups, encounter result panel).

## Phase 2 — Rules Depth (MVP+)
- Expand strike/check resolution coverage (degrees of success, condition interactions).
- Add additional enemy profiles and action variants.
- Improve AI decision quality while keeping deterministic tests.

## Phase 3 — Content & UX Polish
- Add more encounter layouts and data-driven authoring flow.
- Improve turn clarity and targeting UX.
- Balance pass for encounter duration and difficulty curve.

## Phase 4 — Release Hardening
- Regression-focused EditMode/PlayMode expansion.
- CI reliability and branch protections.
- Bugfix/stability sprint and release candidate checklist.
